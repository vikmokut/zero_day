Experimenting with Creating and Connecting Remote and Locale Repo

Subsequently we have been achieving this working from a sandbox.
This is the first instance of experimenting using our local machine.

This is getting more interesting.

Actions:

1. Create a github repo, zero_day without README.md, .gitignore or Licence.
2. Set repo to public
3. Create directory in local and initialize dir and add the remote origin
4. Create README.md file with a text editor.
5. Add, commit and push changes to remote repo.
